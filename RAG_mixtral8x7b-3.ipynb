            "There are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\n",
            "Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are theresult of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immuneresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,white blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest bodytissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,and enzymes.\n",
            "An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\n",
            "begins with a process called inflammation. Initially, asthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,several events occur:\n",

            "to liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easilydigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-toms just like any other infection. These include chills,fever , aching, and general discomfort.\n",
            "Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\n",
            "same process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—sterile because there is no infection involved.

Males who assault a female tend to haveexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directedagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor thewomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolateother sources of protection and support.

Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities, including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions. Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-duction of GH.\n",
            "Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\n",
            "from another brain structure, the hypothalamus, locatedat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones.

As thesetumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within thebrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interferingwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. Inrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production ofGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\n",

In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).This is the all-important site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all partsof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS isone of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, theother being heart failure .\n",

Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the blood(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-branes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often calledhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather becomescarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower, and in time they, too, maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungsas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes muchharder for the patient to breathe.\n",

            "Definition\n",
            "AIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency\n",
            "syndrome tests, cover a number of different proceduresused in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\n",
            "Purpose\n",
            "AIDS serology serves several different purposes.\n",
            "Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\n",
            "In order to understand the different purposes of the\n",
            "blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\n",
            "• by sexual contact\n",
            "• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\n",
            "urine)\n",
            "• by transmission during pregnancy ,o r\n",
            "• through transfusion of infected blood products\n",
            "A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\n",
            "called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, andmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cellsand B cells) in the human immune system to respond toinfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\n",
            "Precautions\n",
            "In some states such as New York, a signed consent\n",
            "form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. Aswith all blood tests, healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins.\n",

            "persons in high-risk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons whohave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\n",
            "It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\n",
            "the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—ittakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\n",

A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-ond antibody.\n",

It is questionable whether PCR will replaceWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generatedan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelmingmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISAscreening within one to three months of infection. Inaddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge ofthe genetic sequences in HIV .

This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen.

Mast cells display a special typeof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), ontheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicalsin small packets, called granules. When the antibodiesencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of thesechemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of theseother cells, through special proteins called histaminereceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors onblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increasedredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritatedeyes.

Personality changes occur, which may includeemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-ity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink andlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\n",

            "of the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. InAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twistedand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems, manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’sability to perform normal activities of daily living.\n",

            "and the development of AD are unknown. AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,environmental, and others not yet identified. Two typesof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, withno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described interms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring inpeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those\n",
            "65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 ofAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some casesof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than themore common late-on-set type.\n",
            "All FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have\n",
            "been identified so far are the early on-set type. As manyas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes. Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells.\n",
            "There is no evidence that the mutated genes that\n",
            "cause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene onthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), calledAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent, and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies ofone. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect somepeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found inthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e4.

Hav-ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as muchas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyonewith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it canstill have the disease.

A combi-nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia; thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.\n",

Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It isknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not thesame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-sciousness is more widespread.When general anesthesia was first introduced in\n",

During most surgical procedures, anesthet-ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\n",

One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is theserum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced toproduce energy without oxygen, as would happen duringanoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, anincrease in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis-sues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygenpathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con-tains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, someforms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrationsin the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels arenot associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for thistest is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition.\n",

            "that has devastating effects on joints and general health. Itis classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis-ease is caused by the body’s own immune system actingagainst the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff,swollen joints, fever ,fatigue , and loss of appetite.\n",
            "In recent years, there has been a change in attitude\n",
            "concerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi-cians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs(DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and areless inclined to wait for crippling stages before resortingto the more potent drugs.

            "vous system of human beings is “hard-wired” to respondto dangers or threats. These responses are not subject toconscious control, and are the same in humans as inlower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptationto the animal predators and other dangers with which allanimals, including primitive humans, had to cope. Themost familiar reaction of this type is the so-called “fight-or-flight” reaction. This response is the human organ-ism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation.It is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousalmarked by high muscle tension and strong feelings offear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac-tion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises.They become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate,their heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases,and their digestion slows down, allowing more energy tobe available to the muscles.\n",
            "This emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the\n",
            "nervous system called the autonomic nervous system, orANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-cialized part of the brainstem that is among a group ofstructures called the limbic system. The limbic systemcontrols human emotions through its connections toglands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and“higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor-tex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbicsystem cannot tell the difference between a realisticphysical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.The hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-mones by the pituitary gland, even when there is noexternal and objective danger. A second problem iscaused by the biochemical side effects of too many “falsealarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a realdanger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones byrunning away or by fighting. In modern life, however,people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations inwhich they can neither run away nor lash out physically.As a result, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi-cal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them.These biochemical changes can produce anxious feel-ings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp-toms associated with anxiety. They may even producepermanent changes in the brain, if the process occursrepeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such ascoronary artery disease , may be worsened by anxiety,\n",

Goodheartfound that by treating the muscle and making it strongagain, he was able to improve the function of the organ aswell. For example, if a particular nutritional supplementwas given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it wasthe correct supplement for the patient. If the muscleremained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatmentcan be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart alsofound that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat-ed with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle,he was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findingsin 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the firstmethod developed in AK.

They found thislack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti-lization, and changes in symptoms are the importantresults of clinical practice. In addition, they determinedthat some studies that were supposed to be an evalua-tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinicalpractices and principles of AK. However, from studiesadhering to AK principles and employing standardizedtraining by well-trained practitioners, they did statethere was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri-fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud-ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, includingsymptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well-designed studies that account for the individual natureof AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the properclinical context of AK treatment will be informative.Understanding the individual components of theprocess of AK treatment remains important. Studiesaddressing validation of isolated AK procedures needto meet the methodological challenges of studyingappropriate subjects that reflects the current recog-nized practice and understanding of AK.

Arrhythmias occur when the heart-beat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node,an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, ora heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signalfrom traveling down the normal pathway.\n",

Next, if fluids are pre-sent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-rate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato-ry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected intothe joint through the same location by attaching the aspi-rating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium.The purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is tohelp highlight details of areas under study by making themopaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air andwater-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine.Air and iodine may be used together or independently.After the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec-tion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to movethe joint around to distribute the contrast.\n",

Acamera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon tosee a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans-ferred to a monitor located in the operating room at thetime of the arthroscopy. This video technology is alsoimportant for documentation of the arthroscopic proce-dure.

Often, following a recent traumatic injury to ajoint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte-rior viewing of the joint difficult.

There is a long meridian and a short meridian.These two meridians generally have a constant curvatureand are generally perpendicular to each other (regularastigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more thantwo meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart.

The symptoms associated with A-T reflect themain role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu-lar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damagedDNA from being reproduced.

            "The person being tested wears a set of headphones\n",
            "that blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers atest tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, thepatient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that thesound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume andrepeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it.This process is repeated over a wide range of tones orfrequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowestnote played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping-ing of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is notunusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ fromone ear to the other.\n",
            "A second type of audiometry testing uses a headband\n",
            "rather than headphones. The headband is worn with smallplastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct soundthrough the bones of the skull. The patient being testedsenses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations throughthe bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, thetones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes.\n",
            "The results of the audiometry test may be recorded\n",
            "on a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph isgenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one endand high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-board. Low notes are graphed on the left and high noteson the right. The graph also charts the volume of thetones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chartto loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured inunits called decibels. Most of the sounds associated withnormal speech patterns are generally spoken in the rangeof 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing candetect tones between 0-20 decibels.\n",
            "Speech audiometry is another type of testing that\n",
            "uses a series of simple recorded words spoken at variousvolumes into headphones worn by the patient being test-ed. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologistas it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be ableto recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words.\n",

Many peoplethink that bad breath can originate in the stomach orintestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual-ly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carryodor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breathbeing caused from air continually escaping from thestomach is remote.

In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport-ed to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are brokenopen by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho-zoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho-zoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or byinvading the lining of the large intestine. Within the liningof the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substancethat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) orabscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts thatare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in thefeces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-tions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks tomonths, ready to begin the cycle again.\n",

This workled to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s workwas expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, researchperformed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. BarrySterman established that both cats and monkeys could betrained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman thenused his research techniques on human patients withepilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the1970s, other researchers published reports of their use ofbiofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias ,\n",

            "During biofeedback, special sensors are placed on\n",
            "the body. These sensors measure the bodily function thatis causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heartrate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec-tromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-troencophalographic feedback), respiration, and bodytemperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor-mation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as apaper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.\n",
            "While the patient views the instantaneous feedback\n",
            "from the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog-nize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence hisor her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationshipbetween mind and body, the patient can then use thesesame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as theseact as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-ious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,brain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodilyfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.\n",
            "As the biofeedback response takes place, patients\n",
            "can actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant-ly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip-ment.

Problems begin to develop when beta wave averagesfall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-arousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be presentin conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-order, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxietydisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessivestress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizingthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-es on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) andtheta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated withdeep, meditative states, and has been used with somesuccess in substance abuse treatment.\n",

Themonitor displays specific patterns that the patientattempts to change by producing the appropriate type ofbrain wave.

A lancet orscalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on theunderside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loadedblade device is most commonly used to make a stan-dard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that nosuperficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, becauseof their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial-ly in people with bleeding defects. The time from whenthe stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped ismeasured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec-onds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw offthe blood.

Lymph will work its way back to thebloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics.Along the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta-tions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes.Nearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph nodegroup filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes fromthat organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes areunder the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumorbegins in the breast and the first place to which it is likelyto spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as itinvades in its place of origin, may also work its way intoblood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, theblood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer tospread to other organs of the body.\n",
            "Breast cancer follows this classic progression though\n",
            "it often becomes systemic or widespread early in thecourse of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump inthe breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in sizeand contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that atumor of this size may take one to five years to develop.During that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spreadby lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body.\n",
            "When primary breast cancer spreads, it may first go\n",
            "to the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil-lary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If itproceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-bornespread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that mayinvolve a number of other organs in the body. Favoritesites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are thelung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turnsout, the presence of, and the actual number of, regionallymph nodes containing cancer remains the single bestindicator of whether or not the cancer has become widelymetastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in otherorgans may not be sensitive enough to reveal minutedeposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta-sis becomes very important in making treatment deci-sions for this disease.\n",
